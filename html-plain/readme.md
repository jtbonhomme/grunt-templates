# HTML Plain

This GruntJS template initializes a plain HTML project. It uses SASS ( Compass ) and the HTML5 boilerplate. That's it.

Thereby it generates a Gruntfile.js which supports [uglify](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-uglify), the [Jasmine Testing](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-jasmine) framework and the [Grunt Watch](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch) command.

## Installation
If you haven't already done so, install [grunt-init](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-init).

Once grunt-init is installed, place this template in your `~/.grunt-init/` directory.

_(Windows users, see [the documentation][grunt-init] for the correct destination directory path)_

## Usage

At the command-line, cd into an empty directory, run this command and follow the prompts.

```
grunt-init html-plain
```

_Note that this template will generate files in the current directory, so be sure to change to a new directory first if you don't want to overwrite existing files._
