# Grunt Templates
[GruntJS](http://gruntjs.com/) is a very powerful tool for a frontend developer. But even for backend developers GruntJS can be really useful. This project is used to automate my own proces in building web applications. This is a scaffold project for all your projects.

## Grunt-init
These templates are generated by the grunt plugin: [grunt-init](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-init). "Grunt-init is scaffolding tool to automate project creation."

Grunt-init is a dependency for these templates to be installed.

## Usage
Using one of the templates is really easy. First clone the repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:stefanvermaas/grunt-templates.git
```

Than move the templates you want to use to the grunt-init folder.
```
# linux
cp -r template-name/ ~/.grunt-init/template-name
```

Now the template is saved to the grunt-init folder and you can use the grunt-init command to generate a new project.

```
grunt-init template-name
```
