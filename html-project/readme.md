# HTML Project

This GruntJS template is very useful for scaffolding an HTML project. It uses SASS; [Compass](http://compass-style.org/), [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/), [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/) and Toffee ( an tiny HTML class grid based on Neat ). 

It also supports jQuery version 1.9.1 through CDN and local as a backup, when CDN fails.

Thereby it generates a Gruntfile.js which supports [uglify](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-uglify), the [Jasmine Testing](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-jasmine) framework and the [Grunt Watch](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch) command.

## Installation
If you haven't already done so, install [grunt-init](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-init).

Once grunt-init is installed, place this template in your `~/.grunt-init/` directory.

_(Windows users, see [the documentation][grunt-init] for the correct destination directory path)_

## Usage

At the command-line, cd into an empty directory, run this command and follow the prompts.

```
grunt-init html-project
```

_Note that this template will generate files in the current directory, so be sure to change to a new directory first if you don't want to overwrite existing files._
